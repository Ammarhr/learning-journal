# What can do with Javascript:
**Javascript** make the wep page more entraction and enteresting, but even more.
__Javascript__ can access to the content of the page and modify it.
**Javascript** deals and react to the event that trigged by both of users and the browser.

We can add a lot of stuff to the web page that the user can act with, like:
 **Slide shows**: it can be reacts by the browser or the users manually.
 **forms**: used to make an input from the user for validation things.
 
 ## Functions:
 __functions__ allow a group of set of statement to perfome togother to performe a specific task. 
 we can declare the functions by giving it a name and then the statement.
 syntex of function:
 . function name ( a ,b ){
 statement
 
 returne;
 }
 We use __functions__ to make our code more neat and organized. it is to don't repeat uorself by using feature called __calling functions__
 we calling functions by the name of it: name();
