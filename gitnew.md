# What is Git?
__Git__ is a distributed version-control system for tracking changes in source code during software development.
It is designed for coordinating work among programmers, but it can be used to track changes in any set of files. 
Its goals include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows. 

 * **Get** is a DVCS that stores data in a file system made up of snapshots. thats snapshots is created when you make a change in the project, the new version is called commit, and all refrances will store to a snapshots.
 * The most importent informations mostly can be found in local resorces, so that **Git** depend on local operations.
 * **Get** will track every singel change aplied to any part of project.
 * **Get** work helpfully to minimize the demages or loss of data that may happen.
 * In **Get*** , files depend on tree states: 
    - __committed__: to avoid loss of data, the data is stored is a local database.
    - __modified__: the changes that have done but not committed in the local database.
    - __staged__: marked a fileâ€™s changed version to be committed in the next snapshot.

## Version Control:
 **Version Control** is a system that allows the devlopers to back to any version of file or more.
 this can be done with the recording changes.
 **Version Control** is helpfull to fix the mistakes in the previous versions, and compare the changes.
