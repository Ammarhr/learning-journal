# PROCESS AND DESIGN SAMMARY:
The design of any good web site must goes though stages and process, and the well build websites take care about this process and give it all the interest.

### So, what is the process of creating a new web site?
There are many points that the web deviloper shoud give attention and focus the most to make a good web site.  the first of all is the target audiance of the site, beacuse it is not just for the owner.
The designer should detemines what is **Targer Audiance**  age range? the gender? the countries? and education level of them? etc..
the second thing is the goal of the visitors of the site. like what the information they search for? what is their goal of this information? is it for personal or professional reasons? what the contant they want?
one of most important point is the update the informations in the web site. **Ex: fashion sites dosen't update thier informations as fast as news sites**.

Somthing like __Wireframes__ will make easier for the designer to know where the stuff will be and how it is organize without determinds how it will looks like.
**Wireframe** is a simple sketch of the site, that determines where the information will go on the page and the space it need.
