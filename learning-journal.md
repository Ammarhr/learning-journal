“basic” text editor vs coding-specific text editor vs IDE:
The first necessity to iron out involves understanding how an IDE and text editor differs from each other. After that, you can start weighing the pros and cons and make a well-informed conclusion.

An IDE has complementing features meant to help web developers accomplish tasks with higher productivity.
For example, when using an IDE, programmers can access databases or automatically write code to create a graphical user interface (GUI). 
Furthermore, some IDEs provide suggested ways to complete strings of code. That means you don’t have to type the entire line and save time.
In contrast, a text editor only does as its name describes and allows writing and making changes to the text. Once a programmer creates code in a text editor,
they can then input the content into command-line windows.
